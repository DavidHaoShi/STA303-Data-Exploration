# STA303-Data-Exploration
Data exploration project for STA303
Working with the most up-to-date COVID data for the City of Toronto to explore data by doing data visualizations.
Daily: Data as of January 18, 2021.
Neighbourhood: Data as of January 17, 2021.

In tasks 1 and 2,  the ‘Cases by Day’ and ‘Cases by Outbreak Type and Week’ graphs are created.
In task 3 we used data about Toronto’s neighbourhoods, where it is drawn from the Toronto COVID portal, under ‘Neighbourhood Maps’, as well as neighbourhood profile data from the 2016 census, from the OpenData Toronto portal.
